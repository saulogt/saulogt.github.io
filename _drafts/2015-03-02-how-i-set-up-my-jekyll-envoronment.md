First of all, I dont stop to say that I am amazed about how simple to publish posts using Jekyll + Github.

The editor: I started using Sublime Text with Jekyll plugin to speed up the process. The plugin is great, but it has a strange configurtion procedures and it sounded a tittle intrusive. Another thing that I found is dificult to setup is the markdown spell checking.
Now I am considering to test Atom, since I've read this great blog post about it (http://www.exaforge.com/blog-workflow/). The markdown preview looks useful.

The hosting: It is so easy to publish using Github, that it doesn't make any sense working differently.
