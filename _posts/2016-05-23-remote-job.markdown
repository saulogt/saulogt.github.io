What hold you back from work wherever you what?

I've been planing this for a long time. Gathering information and developing the skills necessary to become a good remote worker. Finally I did it!
I'm a software developer, so you can imagine that it is not difficult for me, it is true. The technology is there to provide mobility and perfomance. However, we have the human factor, that is unpredictable. We have our fears, other people fears (spouse, boss, parents), we have organization cultural barriers and every kind of excuse we can invent.

The company that I work for is in Brazil-Rio de Janeiro and I live in Canada-Vancouver. It is four hours difference in timezone now and can be 6 hours due to daylight.
