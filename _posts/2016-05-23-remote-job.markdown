What hold you back from work wherever you what?

I've been planing this for a long time. Gathering information and developing the skills necessary to become a good remote worker. Finally I did it! (I think)
I'm a software developer, so you can imagine that it is not difficult for me, it is true. The technology is there to provide mobility and performance. However, we have the human factor, that is unpredictable. We have our fears, other people fears (spouse, boss, parents), we have organization cultural barriers and every kind of excuse we can invent.

There are some points the I consider important to manage in order to have a good experience working remotely:

## Discipline

### Be consistent
Set the time you will work. When we work from home we tend to procrastinate more. You know... The TV is there, nobody is looking to us, etc. Setting a time to work is effective.
Another trick is wear shoes and clothes as if you are at an office. It can be a psychological trigger to switch to work mode.

### Create a system

A system that work for me is the Pomodoro Technique. You basically set a 25 minutes timebox "protected" from any interruption so that you can measure you performance on sifferent tasks. There are many free apps for mobile or desktop that you can use to assist you. Seach for `Pomodoro Technique`

## Tools

### Trello

### Github / Bitbucket

### Schedule apps. (Calendly, ScheduleOnce, etc)
